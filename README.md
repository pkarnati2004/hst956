*From Abstract* 
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerativedisorder that causes the impairment of certain movementfunctions. It manifests itself heterogeneously across differentpatients, and it is also diagnosed and staged via relativelysubjective processes, making it hard to study in an objectivemanner. In this paper, we investigate Parkinson’s progressionand stage Parkinson’s using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)images and critical biomarker data as more objective datasources. A convolutional neural network (CNN) extracts fea-tures from the imaging data, and k-means clustering groupstogether images with common features. By adding in biomarkerdata, we develop a fuller picture of the heterogeneity of thisdisease, but also of the commonalities that draw certain clusterstogether
